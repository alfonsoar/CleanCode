+++

>The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are
>constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code

---

### Why is Clean Code Important

![Graph](assets/image/productivityTime.png)

Note:
- Time is Application Age
- Technical Debt
- Complexity of Project

---

### What is Clean Code to you?

![Comic](assets/image/cleanCodeComic.png){ width: 80%, height: 80% }

+++

> I like my code to be **elegant** and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies **minimal** to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does **one** thing well.

Note:
- Elegant
- Minimal
- One

+++

>Clean code is **simple** and direct. Clean code reads like well-written **prose**. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

Note:
- Simple
- Prose: Code is functional
- Art / Artists

### Agenda

- Naming |
- Functions |
- Code Readability |
- Refactoring |
- Kata |

---

![Naming](assets/image/Naming.jpg)

Fun Fact: My firstborn male child will be called *Maximus*
---

### Naming

- Intention revealing names |
- Meaningful distinctions | 
- Searchable names |
- Avoid mental mapping |
- Nouns for classes and variables and verbs for functions |

---
#### Intention revealing names

```java
public List<int[]> getThem() {
  List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] x : theList)
    if (x[0] == 4)
      list1.add(x);
  return list1;
}
```

- What does this code do? |
- Why does it do it? |

+++

#### Compared to

```java
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
  for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell.isFlagged())
      flaggedCells.add(cell));
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

- How about now? |

---

#### Meaningful distinction

##### Function Names

```
getActiveAccount();
getActiveAccounts();
getActiveAccountInfo();
```

@[1-3](Which one would you use to get the Active Account?)

+++

##### Variable Names

```
moneyAmount vs money
customerInfo vs customer
theMessage vs message
accountData vs account
```

@[1-4](Don't make variables compete for attention)

---

#### Avoid Mental Mapping

```python
for i in range(34):
  s += (t[i]*4)/5;
```

@[2](Clearly everyone knows why we multiply times 4 and divide by 5)

+++ 

#### Searchable Names

```python
real_days_per_ideal_day = 4
work_days_per_week = 5
number_of_tasks = len(task_estimates)
sum = 0
for i in range(number_of_tasks):
  real_days = task_estimates[i] * real_days_per_ideal_day
  real_weeks = (real_days / work_days_per_week)
  sum += real_weeks
```
@[1-8](How about now?)
@[4](Although this name is great, it shadows a built in function)
@[3, 5](Why acces via array? Why not For In?)

---

#### Good naming can replace comments

```python
# Check to see if the employee is elegibile for bonus
if (employee.flag and employee.rating >= 4 and employee.years > 5)

if (employee.isEligibleForBonus())
```

Note:
- is / has Function Names
---

### Functions

- Functons should be small, the smaller the better |
- A function should only do one thing |
- One level of abstraction |
- Less arguments are better |
- Impure Sandwhich -> No side effects* |

---

#### Building Blocks

![Blocks](assets/image/blocks.jpeg)

Note:
- Level Of Astraction
- Composing
- Small

---

#### Code Examples 

```java
public void Checkout()
{
  Price CurrentPrice = new Price();
  foreach(var product in CurrentShoppingCart)
    CurrentPrice.Add(product.Price);
  foreach(var coupon in CurrentDiscounts)
    CurrentPrice.Discount(coupon.Price);

  var billingInfo = BillingRepository.get(BillingId);
  if (billingInfo.CheckIfStillValid() == False)
  {
    DisplayError("Invalid Billing Information")
    return;
  }

  var paymentResult = PaymentGateway.Charge(billingInfo, CurrentPrice);
  if (paymentResult.Success == false)
  {
    DisplayError("Payment Processing Error");
    return;
  }
  DisplayMessage("Thank you for your order");
}
```
@[3-7](We first Calculate our Price by summing product prices and subtracting discount prices)
@[9-14](We then confirm if the billing info is valid)
@[16-23](Finally we charge the billingInfo card the currentPrice)
@[1-24](Think we can use our magic refactoring wand?)

+++

```java
public void Checkout()
{
  UpdateCurrentTotalPrice()
  ChargeCustomer()
  DisplayResult()
}

private void UpdateCurrentTotalPrice()
{
  Price CurrentPrice = new Price()
  SumShoppingCartProductsToCurrentPrice(CurrentPrice);
  ApplyShoppingCartDiscountsToCurrentPrice(CurrentPrice);
}

private void SumShoppingCartProductsToCurrentPrice()
{
  foreach(var product in CurrentShoppingCart)
    CurrentPrice.Add(product.Price);
}

// etc ...
```

@[1-6](High Level Abstraction)
@[8-13](Mid Level Abstraction)
@[15-19](Detail Level)

#### Impure Sandwich

![Sandwich](assets/image/cookie_sandwich.png)

Fun Fact: I love ice cream sandwiches

+++

```python
# Simplified version of making a reservation at a restaurant
def makeReservation(quantity, date, restaurantId):
	restaurant = Restaurant.getRestaurant(restaurantId) # ORM 
	reservationsOnDate = filter(lambda reservation: reservation.date == date, restaurant.reservations)
	available_seats = restaurant.capacity - len(reservationsOnDate)
	if available_seats >= quantity:
		return Restaurant.reserve(data, quanitity) # Returns a reservation String from db call
	else:
		return None # Client Handles None
```

@[2-9](Code is easy to read, seems straighfoward what we are doing)
@[3](Here is our culprit, making we are mixing a database call with our business logic)
@[4-6](This is our business logic)
@[7](More of this impure **Hogwash**!)

+++

```python
# Impure Function Call
def getRestaurant(restaurantId):
	restaurant = Restaurant.getRestaurant(restaurant)


# Business Logic
@_.curry
def canMakeReservation(quantity, date, restaurant):
	reservationsOnDate = filter(lambda reservation: reservation.date == date, restaurant.reservations)
	available_seats = restaurant.capacity - len(reservationsOnDate)
	if available_seats >= quantity:
		return Some(Reservation(quantity, date)) # Creates a reservation object
	else:
		return None

#Impure Function Call
def reserve(reservation):
	return Restaurant.reserve(reservation)

# Yummy Impure Sandwhich
def makeReservation(quantity, date, restaurantId):
	return _.compose(
			getRestaurant(restaurantId),
			canMakeReservation(quantity, date),
			lambda reservation: reserve(reservation) if reservation else None # Does your language have Options?
		)
```
@[1-3](First Impure DB Call)
@[6-14](Business Logic Pure Function)
@[16-18](Second Impure DB Call)
@[20-26](We build our impure sandwhich via compose)
@[25](**Note** This Janky Ternary Operation, Does your language support Option?)

### Code Readability

- Nested Code sucks |
- Looping |
- Formatting Code |
- Broken Windows |

---

#### Nested Code

![Graph](assets/image/nestedIf.jpg)

---

#### Looping 
##### Shameless Functional Programming Plug

```javascript
// Artists with popularity <= 3 percentage of given playlist
func getHipsterArtists(playlist) {
	const maxPopularity = 3
	let artists = []
	// Get All the artists from a playlist and filter only unpopular artists
	for(let songIndex = 0; songIndex < playlist.length; songIndex++) {
		const artistsCount = playlist[songIndex].artists.length
	    for (let artistIndex = 0; artistIndex  < artistsCount; artistIndex++) {
	        if playlist[songIndex][artistIndex].popularity <= 3 {
	        	artists.append(playlist[songIndex][artistIndex].name)
	        }
	}
	return artists
}

//Functional with ES6
const getHipsterArtists = (playlist) => {
	const maxPopularity = 3
	return playlist.
		flatMap(song => song.artists).
		filter(artists => artists.popularity <= maxPopularity).
		map(artists => artists.name)
}
```
@[2-13](Imperative Programming, you have to read deep in the code to see exactly whats happening)
@[15-22](Functional Programming, concise and clean, generally no need for comments)
@[2-13](This is a small example, but have you seen double/triple for loops with maybe 3 or 4 if statements inside?)

---

#### Formatting Code

- Horizontal - Line Length |
- Vertical - File Size |
- Indentation |
- Consistency |
- Style Guide & Linter |

--- 

#### Broken Windows

+++

### Refactoring

- Types of Requirements |
- Refactoring |
- Technical Debt |
- Code Smells |

---

#### Types of Requirements

- Functional |
- Operational | 
- Developmental |

Note:
- Functional: Use cases, features
- Operational: Performance, SLA
- Developmental: Developers QOL
- Raise hand if you have had a refactoring sprint or investment to just improve code readability


---

#### Refactoring

![Stickmen](http://deus.co.uk/images/refactoring.png)

---

#### Why Refactor

+++

>By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with.

---

#### What Is Refactoring

+++

> Code Refactoring is the process of clarifying and simplifying the design of existing code, without changing its behavior.

---


#### When 

- Brittle Code |
- Turn around times on Functional Requirements increased |
- Debugging takes longer |
- Onboarding New Joiners takes longer |
- Code Smells |

---

#### Technical Debt

+++

> The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer

+++

![Technical_Debt](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/images/code-smell-2.jpg)

---

#### Code Smells

+++

> A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system

---

#### Code Smell Categories

- Bloaters |
- Object orientation Abusers |
- Change Preventers |
- Dispensables |
- Couplers |

Note:
- Gargantuan Porpotion
- Incorrect Application of OO
- Makes change so expensive you dont want to do it
- Pointless/uneeded
- Excessive Coupling 

---

# Kata

Note:
- Naming: clear and concise
- Functions: level of abstraction, one thing, small
- Code smells: are there any?
- Refactor: where would you refactor

---

### How to write unmaintanable code

- Use horrible naming for variables and functions |
- Don't break up your functions into abstract levels |
- Make your code look like a maze |
- Compete to see who has the most technical debt |
